You don't need to necessarily download the rbxl file, it's just if you want to see everything else I put. I theorize that the problem might be that I'm implementing something
incorrectly, although I'm not sure what. The neural network framework I created might be the culprit because it's been months since I've created it and I don't remember
much about how the code works. Although, I did tests on it and it seemed to work fine and be able to learn functions. My second suspect would probably be the target
q value or experience replay, either one.
